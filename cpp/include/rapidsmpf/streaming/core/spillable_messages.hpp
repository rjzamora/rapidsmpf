 * @brief Container for individually spillable messages.

 * `SpillableMessages` manages a collection of `Message` instances that can be
 * spilled or extracted independently. Each message is assigned a unique

 * The container is thread-safe for concurrent insertions, extractions, and
 * spills.

 * ### Example
 * @code{.cpp}
 * SpillableMessages messages;
 * auto id = messages.insert(to_message(TableChunk{...}));
 * messages.spill(id, ...);
 * auto msg = messages.extract(id);
