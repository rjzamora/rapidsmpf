     * (including other pending requests) makes progress within the configured

     *
     * The timeout does not apply specifically to this request. Instead, it is used
     * as a global progress guarantee: if no pending reservation request can be

     * When multiple reservation requests are eligible, `MemoryReserveOrWait` uses
     * @p net_memory_delta as a heuristic to prefer requests that are expected to
     * reduce memory pressure sooner. The value represents the estimated net change
     * in memory usage after the reservation has been allocated and the dependent
     * operation completes (that is, the memory impact after both allocating @p size
     * and finishing the work that consumes the reservation):
     *   - > 0: expected net increase in memory usage

     *   - < 0: expected net decrease in memory usage
     *

     *   - Reading data from disk into memory typically has a positive
     *     @p net_memory_delta (memory usage increases).
     *   - A row-wise transformation that retains input and output typically has a
     *     net delta near zero (memory-neutral).
     *   - Writing data to disk or a reduction that frees inputs typically has a
     *     negative @p net_memory_delta (memory usage decreases).
     *
     * @param size Number of bytes to reserve.
     * @param net_memory_delta Estimated net change in memory usage after the
