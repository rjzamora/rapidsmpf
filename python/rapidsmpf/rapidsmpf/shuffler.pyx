cdef class Shuffler:
    """
    Shuffle service for partitioned data.

    The `rapidsmpf.shuffler.Shuffler` class provides an interface for
    performing a shuffle operation on partitioned data. It uses a
    distribution scheme to distribute and collect data chunks across
    different ranks.

    Parameters
    ----------
    comm
        The communicator to use for data exchange between ranks.
    progress_thread
        The progress thread to use for tracking progress.
    op_id
        The operation ID of the shuffle. Must have a value between 0 and
        ``max_concurrent_shuffles-1``.
    total_num_partitions
        Total number of partitions in the shuffle.
    br
        The buffer resource used to allocate temporary storage and shuffle results.
    statistics
        The statistics instance to use. If None, statistics is disabled.

    Attributes
    ----------
    max_concurrent_shuffles
        Maximum number of concurrent shufflers.

    Notes
    -----
    This class is designed to handle distributed operations by partitioning data
    and redistributing it across ranks in a cluster. It is typically used in
    distributed data processing workflows involving cuDF tables.

    The caller promises that inserted buffers are stream-ordered with respect to
    their own stream, and extracted buffers are likewise guaranteed to be stream-
    ordered with respect to their own stream.

        - The caller thread will perform the concatenation, and hence it will be
          blocked.
        - Concatenation may cause device memory pressure.
