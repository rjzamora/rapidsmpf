cdef class Context:
    """
    Context for nodes (coroutines) in rapidsmpf.

    The context owns shared resources used during execution, including the
    coroutine executor and memory reservation infrastructure.

    A ``Context`` instance must be created and shut down on the same thread.
    Shutting down the context from a different thread results in program
    termination. This is particularly important in coroutine-based code, where
    execution and stack unwinding may occur on different threads if ownership
    is not carefully managed.

    In Python, it is easy to accidentally keep dangling references to a
    ``Context`` instance, which may delay destruction and cause shutdown to
    occur on an unintended thread. For this reason, it is strongly recommended
    to use ``Context`` as a context manager (that is, via a ``with`` statement),
    which guarantees that ``shutdown()`` is invoked deterministically and on
    the same thread that created the context.

    Parameters
    ----------
    comm
        The communicator to use.
    br
        The buffer resource to use.
    options
        The configuration options to use. Missing options are read from environment
        variables.
    statistics
        The statistics to use. If None, statistics are disabled.

    --------
